<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Clifford Bayangos, 21 years old, cuurently living in the Philippines.
  I am 3rd year IT student in Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa (PLMUN). 
</p>

<p>I created this personal website to improve my skills in web development. With the help of courses and tutorials I found on the internet,
  I hope that I can improve this website little by little. 
</p>

<p>
  One of my plan is to treat this website as my portfolio. 
  All of the projects I created and will create will be linked somewhere in this website.
  I am also thinking to incorporate my personal blogs because I like to share my thoughts and experiences to other people.
  At the moment, I am writing and posting my blogs to Hive, a blogging platform/social media based on blockchain.
  You can visit it if you like!
</p>

<p>For now, that all. I hope you enjoy your stay here in my personal website. Feel free to explore.  
  Expect some changes of UI and UX, and additional contents from time to time especially
  that I just started learning web development. If you have suggestions or any idea to improve my website, you can contact me. </p>
